## Introduction

The FAIR principles were created to help researchers share, reuse, and manage their data.  A common layperson's interpretation of FAIR data is a dataset that can be:
- discovered and downloaded by others; and
- interpreted correctly through the provision of detailed descriptions about the data.

Descriptions of data (metadata) enables appropriate reuse.  This is similar to other aspects of data handling published research, such as figures in papers, where titles and notes are given as well as descriptions of axes where data are plotted.  The provision of metadata is key to FAIR.


Note that FAIR is not limited to the Life Sciences and spans across all research disciplines. The FAIR principles are also not limited to data, but can be applied to the sharing and reuse of software and data workflow. 

## So, what is FAIR?

FAIR is an acronym summarising the 4 principles of data being: **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**esuable.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
To apply FAIR to your data (and metadata), each principle has a subset of specific requirements that can be used as a checklist.  Note, we put these into context later in this course when we take real datasets through FAIRification.  This checklist and further level of granularity is given in **BOX 2** of  Nature 2016 publication [FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)
